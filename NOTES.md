PLanning Cli Project

1.Think of something i would personally like
2.make github repo
3.make a gem
4.make structure
5.make sure it runs and prints 'working' from cli.rb by running bin/run
6.hardcode project
7.start scraping
8.check cli checklist off learn site


Process.
i want to call from to to the Cli,
the Cli to call upon scarping and return that to the cli, and it should be able to create a new player using  the retrieved data from cli.
I want the roster to be shown and the user to be able to pick a player and ged more info on the player
possible move-i don't think it will serve a purpose there because im gonna ask the user to interact in the roster method when a new player is created


Need to have an understanding of instance & class methods
what an instance variable is
